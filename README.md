# tessellation
![Tests](https://github.com/ilikecubesnstuff/tessellation/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

A package for tessellating orbits and evaluating their "measure" (the area/volume covered by its path). This is related to an orbit's "commensurability". The [commensurability package](https://github.com/ilikecubesnstuff/commensurability) uses this to analyze galactic potentials.
